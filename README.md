## Introduction
Layoffs are an important economic indicator, reflecting company performance and broader economic trends. This project seeks to analyze layoff data to uncover insights, visualize trends, and predict future occurrences across various industries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on layoffs from various companies across multiple industries. The data includes:
- Company name
- Industry
- Number of employees laid off
- Date of the layoff
- Location
- Other relevant attributes

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in this project to ensure accuracy and reliability. The process involves:
- Handling missing values
- Correcting inconsistencies
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Addressing outliers

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to:
- Understand the distribution of layoffs
- Identify patterns and trends
- Explore relationships between different variables
- Summarize the main characteristics of the dataset

## Visualization
Data visualization helps in:
- Communicating findings effectively
- Highlighting significant trends and anomalies
- Providing a clear and intuitive understanding of the data
Visualizations will be created using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Forecasting
Forecasting involves predicting future layoff trends using historical data. This part of the project includes:
- Time series analysis
- Trend analysis
- Industry-specific forecasts
- Evaluating the accuracy of prediction models

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layoffs-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd layoffs-analysis`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the data cleaning script: `python data_cleaning.py`
2. Perform EDA: `python eda.py`
3. Generate visualizations: `python visualize.py`
4. Execute forecasting analysis: `python forecast.py`
